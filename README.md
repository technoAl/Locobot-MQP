# Overview
This repo consists of the python files that we use to control the LocoBot. 

Specifically, the ```arm_controller_vertical.py``` contains all the relevant code for controlling the arm during the use of the system with the HoloLens and Workspace Cameras

Please see [PyRobot Read the docs](https://pyrobot-next.readthedocs.io/en/api_0.4/) for information on how to program the robot. The rest is basic ROS communication and robot IK.
